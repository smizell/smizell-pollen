◊h2{Currently Reading}

◊em{Metaphors We Live By}: Maggie Appleton recommended this book in her
presentation called ◊a[#:href
"https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1254389176243535873"]{Drawing the Invisible}. 
Her presentation and the book have both had lots of interesting observations and ideas.

◊h2{Currently Watching}

◊em{What We Do in the Shadows}: Weird, funny, and kind of gross. But fun--kind of.
